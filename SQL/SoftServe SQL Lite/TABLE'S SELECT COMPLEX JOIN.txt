There are 2 tables
  CUSTOMERS(ID, FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME, ADDRESS);
  ORDERS (ID, PRODUCT_NAME, PRODUCT_PRICE, DATE_ORDER DATE, ID_CUSTOMER, AMOUNT);

Show first and last names of all customers from CUSTOMERS table and appropriate product names from ORDERS table, also show customers without orders and orders without customers (if any). Please sort the data by First name, last name and product name.



PS. The SQL version doesn't support FULL JOIN so please try to find something else


SELECT FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME, PRODUCT_NAME
FROM CUSTOMERS
LEFT JOIN ORDERS ON CUSTOMERS.ID = ORDERS.ID_CUSTOMER
UNION
SELECT FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME, PRODUCT_NAME
FROM ORDERS
LEFT JOIN CUSTOMERS ON ORDERS.ID_CUSTOMER = CUSTOMERS.ID
WHERE CUSTOMERS.ID IS NULL
ORDER BY FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME, PRODUCT_NAME
