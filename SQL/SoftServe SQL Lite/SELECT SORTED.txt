There are 2 tables
  CUSTOMERS(ID, FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME, ADDRESS);
  ORDERS (ID, PRODUCT_NAME, PRODUCT_PRICE, DATE_ORDER, ID_CUSTOMER, AMOUNT);


Find out which products and when have been ordered in our shop. The results should be sorted by ordering date in ascending order and include only top 3 rows.

PS. Please pay attentions that we are using SQLite version of SQL language and "top 3 rows" can be achieved using additional cause in end of the select sentence as additional phrase "limit 3"


SELECT PRODUCT_NAME, DATE_ORDER
FROM ORDERS
ORDER BY DATE_ORDER ASC
LIMIT 3;
